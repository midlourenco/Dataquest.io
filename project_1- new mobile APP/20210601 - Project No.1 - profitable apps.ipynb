    "\n",
    "This project aims to identify what are the more profitable app profiles for the App Store and Google Play markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are data analysts in a company which builds Android and iOS mobile app, and makes those apps available on Google Play and the App Store.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our developers only build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means our revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users who use our app — the more users that see and engage with the ads, the better. Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users.\n",
    "\n",
    "To reach this objective we will need to collect and analyze data about mobile apps available on Google Play and App Store. We we will work with data of 2018 and a data sample reffers to more than 4 million apps (approximatelly 2 million regarding to iOS apps, and 2.1 million to Android apps).\n"

    "**Second step:** If you explore the Google Play data set long enough or look at the [discussions](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps/discussion) section, we found that some apps have duplicate entries. For instance, Instagram has four entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each dataset, we need to identify how many rows we have in this situation and, then find the best way to remove the duplicate rows (we don't want to remove the rows randomly). \n",
    "\n",
    "Checking the example of Instagram, we can see that four entries have the same number of installers, but has different number of reviews. So, this allow us to understand that in this example,   the row with more reviews is the most recent one. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, at the end, we want to keep **the row with more reviews** and eliminate the others.\n",
    "To reach this goal we will do:\n",
    "- First goal - *identify dupplicates*: we construct a dictionary`play_name_freq` - for each app in the android dataset, we will register in this dictionationary its frequency (the number of times that it is in the data base). If one app has duplicated entries we saved its name in the list`duplicate_app` list.\n",
    "- Second goal - *identify the duplicated with more views*: for the apps which has duplicated entries, we construct another dictionary, the `reviews_max` with the app name and its maximum number of the reviews.\n",
    "- Third goal - *eliminate the duplicated rows with less reviews or same as the maximum reviews* - we will construct a lists `android_cleaned` with android data without dupplicate rows. However, we realize that only using the previous dictionary `reviews_max`, to insert condition reviews_max[name] == n_reviews, and then append those rows to our list, we will have more entries than lenght of previous dictionary. This means that we still will have some duplicated entries, which correspond to the entries of each app with same number of reviews (example: 'ZEDGE™ Ringtones & Wallpapers'). To avoid this situation, we create a second list `already_added` where we save the app name already in the data_cleaned and this way we make sure that we have only one entry per app.\n",
    "\n",

    "For iOS data, we stop on first dictionary, because we found each line as a different ID,so it means, there is not duplicate entry there.\n",

    "Other criterias for \"if we have more than one dupplicate app row with same number of reviews\"\n",

    "We would select the one with more installers. However after some verifications, we understood that the installers are exact numbers of installation, but are only intervals of installation \"5,000+\" or \"10,000+\". This way, we think this is not relevant criteria in this analyze, so we will left this criteria behind. Anyway if we really want to use installers, we will need to remove \",\" and \"+\" and transform this in one int(), to can compare which number is bigger.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. we also tried to check if we can use the last update as a solution for this situations.\n",
    "If we have same numbers of reviews, we are interested to select the most recent one.\n",
