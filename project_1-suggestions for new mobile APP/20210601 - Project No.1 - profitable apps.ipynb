    "\n",
    "This project aims to identify what are the more profitable app profiles for the App Store and Google Play markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are data analysts in a company which builds Android and iOS mobile app, and makes those apps available on Google Play and the App Store.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our developers only build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means our revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users who use our app â€” the more users that see and engage with the ads, the better. Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users.\n",
    "\n",
    "To reach this objective we will need to collect and analyze data about mobile apps available on Google Play and App Store. We we will work with data of 2018 and a data sample reffers to more than 4 million apps (approximatelly 2 million regarding to iOS apps, and 2.1 million to Android apps).\n"
