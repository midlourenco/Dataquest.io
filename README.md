Projects done on data science in python course

Project 1: 
- This project aims identify what are the more profitable app profiles for the App Store and Google Play markets.
- Python for Data Science: Fundamentals (Part I and II)

Project 2:
- This project aims to take some conclusions about which posts from Hacker News receive more comments.
- Python for Data Science: Intermediate

Project 3:
- This project aims to explore the data details of used cars sold in eBay.
- Pandas and NumPy Fundamentals 
- Objective: Explore the dataset and tried to find some details about what kind of cars we have in this dataset.
- I propose myself to tried to reply to following questions:
* 4.1 - What are the most commons brands?
* 4.2 - What are the relation between the most commons brands and its mean price?
* 4.3 - What are the relation between the most commons brands and its mean odometer?
* 4.4 - What are the most common brand/model combination?
* 4.5 - How much cheaper are cars with damage than their non-damaged counterparts?
* 4.6 - How much expensive are cars with automatic gearbox?
* 4.7 - How is the price evoluation according to the vehicle type?
- Created filters on data to find replies for these questions

Project 4:
- This project aims  to find heavy traffic indicators on I-94.
- Data Visualization Fundamentals
- Objective: Tried to identify the correlation between variables, to find what could be the factors that cause heavy traffic in the highway I-94.
* during day time vs night time
* during working days vs weekend
- Cleaning dataset and using groupby() function to manipulate the information and create the graphics
- Created exploratory graphics: histograms, line plot, horizontal bar plot, scatter plots and made a grid chart with small multiple graphics
- Reach the oportuniy to explore a little more about how to customise plots using Matplotlib (still without use the styles), adding grid with customised linestyle and Seaborn options.

Project 5:
- Evolution of Euro daily exchange rates
- Storytelling Data Visualization and Information Design
- Objective: In this project we focus on evolution of EUR/USD rate and related its evolution with some historical facts:
* During financial crises (2008) 
* COVID-19 pandemic (2020)
- Cleaned the dataset and made few exploratory graphic to identify what kind of data we have on hands.
- Created explanatory graphics which should be enough to let audience easily understand the storyline just checking graphics
- Focus on remove excess ink and in gestalt principles
- Used style "fivethirtyeight" and customized each plot to reach this project goal; use verticial line/horizontal line, added span areas and used arrow to identify a specific point in graphics
