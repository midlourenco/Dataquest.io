<h2>Projects done on data science in python path</h2>

<h3>**Project 1: **</h3>
<ul>
  <li> This project aims identify what are the more profitable app profiles for the App Store and Google Play markets.
  <li> Python for Data Science: Fundamentals (Part I and II)
</ul>

<h3>**Project 3: **</h3>
<ul>
  <li> This project aims to explore the data details of used cars sold in eBay.</li>
  <li> Pandas and NumPy Fundamentals </li>
  <li> Objective: Explore the dataset and tried to find some details about what kind of cars we have in this dataset.</li>
  <li> I propose myself to tried to reply to following questions in the point 4 of this project:</li>
  <ol>
    <li> 4.1 - What are the most commons brands?</li>
    <li> 4.2 - What are the relation between the most commons brands and its mean price?</li>
    <li> 4.3 - What are the relation between the most commons brands and its mean odometer?</li>
    <li> 4.4 - What are the most common brand/model combination?</li>
    <li> 4.5 - How much cheaper are cars with damage than their non-damaged counterparts?</li>
    <li> 4.6 - How much expensive are cars with automatic gearbox?</li>
    <li> 4.7 - How is the price evoluation according to the vehicle type?</li>
  </ol>
  <li> Created filters on data to find replies for these questions</li>

<h3>**Project 4: **</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> This project aims  to find heavy traffic indicators on I-94.
    <li> Data Visualization Fundamentals
    <li> Objective: Tried to identify the correlation between variables, to find what could be the factors that cause heavy traffic in the highway I-94.
        * during day time vs night time
        * during working days vs weekend
    <li> Cleaning dataset and using groupby() function to manipulate the information and create the graphics
    <li> Created exploratory graphics: histograms, line plot, horizontal bar plot, scatter plots and made a grid chart with small multiple graphics
    <li> Reach the oportuniy to explore a little more about how to customise plots using Matplotlib (still without use the styles), adding grid with customised linestyle and Seaborn options.

  </ul>

<h3>**Project 5: **</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> Evolution of Euro daily exchange rates
    <li> Storytelling Data Visualization and Information Design
    <li> Objective: In this project we focus on evolution of EUR/USD rate and related its evolution with some historical facts:
    * During financial crises (2008) 
    * COVID-19 pandemic (2020)
    <li> Cleaned the dataset and made few exploratory graphic to identify what kind of data we have on hands.
    <li> Created explanatory graphics which should be enough to let audience easily understand the storyline just checking graphics
    <li> Focus on remove excess ink and in gestalt principles
    <li> Used style "fivethirtyeight" and customized each plot to reach this project goal; use verticial line/horizontal line, added span areas and used arrow to identify a specific point in graphics

  </ul>
  
  
  <h3>**Project 6: **</h3>
  <ul>
   <li> Clean and Analyze Employee Exit Surveys from 2 organization in Australia
   <li> Objectives: apply following tools for data cleaning to find the different factors that affect employee resignations:
      * Vectorized string methods to clean string columns
      * The apply(), map(), and applymap() methods to transform data
      * The fillna(), dropna(), and drop() methods to drop missing or unnecessary values
      * The melt() function to reshape data
      * The concat() and merge() functions to combine data
      * Basic Regular Expressions
