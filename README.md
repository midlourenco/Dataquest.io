- Created exploratory graphics: histograms, line plot, horizontal bar plot, scatter plots and made a grid chart with small multiple graphics
- Reach the oportuniy to explore a little more about how to customise plots using Matplotlib (still without use the styles), adding grid with customised linestyle and Seaborn options.
